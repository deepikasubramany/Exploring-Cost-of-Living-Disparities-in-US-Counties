# Exploring-Cost-of-Living-Disparities-in-US-Counties

Understanding the cost of living disparities among various family types and across US counties is crucial for policymakers, researchers, and individuals alike. In this project, we delve into the US Family Budget Dataset, a valuable resource that sheds light on the cost of living in different counties.

The primary objective is to investigate the variations in the cost of living and explore the relationship between family income and overall living expenses. By examining factors such as housing costs, food expenses, transportation, healthcare, and more, we aim to provide insights into the economic dynamics of different regions.

## Problem Statement:

The disparities in the cost of living across US counties pose significant challenges for families and individuals. Understanding these differences is vital for making informed decisions related to relocation, job opportunities, and financial planning. The problem I addressed in this project is the lack of a comprehensive analysis that explores the intricate relationships between family income, demographic factors, and various cost components.

I seek to answer questions such as:

How do housing costs vary across different family types and states?
Is there a correlation between family income and healthcare expenses?
What are the major contributors to the overall cost of living, and how do they differ regionally?
By addressing these questions, I aim to contribute to a better understanding of the factors influencing the cost of living in the United States.

## The Data

The dataset used for this project is the US Family Budget Dataset, which provides detailed information on family incomes and various expenses across different counties. The data includes columns such as 'family_member_count,' 'housing_cost,' 'food_cost,' 'transportation_cost,' 'healthcare_cost,' and more.

The study on Cost of Living Disparities in US Counties employed rigorous methodology, involving data preprocessing with the US Family Budget Dataset and EDA using dplyr, ggplot2, and tidyr. Leveraging machine learning, specifically random forest regression, we modeled the intricate relationship between family income and various cost components. The analysis unveiled significant variations in housing costs influenced by family size and location. Healthcare expenses exhibited correlations with income, shedding light on the economic implications of healthcare access. The results contribute valuable insights for policymakers and individuals, aiding in financial planning, job decisions, and relocation choices.
